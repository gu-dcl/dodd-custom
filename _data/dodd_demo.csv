achebe_pfp,achebe_pfp.jpg,,"Achebe, Chinua (1930-2013)",image/jpg,"Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian novelist and poet most well known for his first novel <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, its sequel <em>No Longer at Ease</em>, and his fifth novel <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em>. Achebe’s first novel is the most widely read and translated African novel of all time, which earned him the title of father of modern African literature. Achebe received several literary awards during his lifetime, including the first Commonwealth Poetry Prize and the Man Booker International Prize in 2007. Achebe’s writing heavily criticizes westernization and British colonialism in Nigeria, as well as inaccurate and racist depictions of Africa in western literature.<br/><br/>

He is also not afraid to criticize Africans on their lack of resistance against colonialism. In <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, Achebe tells the story of Okonkwo, who finds himself fighting against British missionaries and colonists in his village. When he suggests that they fight back, and he does by beheading a messenger, no one else fights with him. He quickly realizes he is one of the only ones resisting colonialism and conversion. In the sequel <em>No Longer at Ease</em>, Okonkwo’s grandson Obi, struggles with his Igbo identity as he becomes more westernized. He is tried in a colonial court for taking a bribe, a similar commentary on the fact that straying away from his Igbo traditions for western beliefs led to his corruption.",,,1930;2013,,biographic image,"Authors, Nigerian;Igbo (African People); ",Nigeria,6.15,6.866667,,,,,,,,,StillImage,eng,thingsfall_pfp; 
anansi_pfp,anansi_pfp.jpg,,Anansi,image/jpg,"Kwaku Anansi is the spider God and a major trickster character in Ghanaian folklore and mythology originally from the Asante people of the Akan ethnic group. Anansi is depicted as a man with eight legs who triumphs over more powerful adversaries by utilizing his wits and cunning nature. His cunningness inspires the Akan word – Anansesem, which describes a story too incredible to believe. In Gold Coast mythology, Anansi is the creator of the world and plays the role of a cultural hero who accomplishes impossible tasks like stealing the sun. Anansi tales were spread throughout the globe through transatlantic slave trade. He entered American folklore as Brer Rabbit and holds space in Western pop culture as Marvel’s Spiderman. Anansi tales are also fundamental to Caribbean folklore, especially Jamaican lore. African slaves in the U.S. regarded, the Anansi inspired character, Brer Rabbit as a resistance figure whose use of brains over brawn empowered slaves to undermine and challenge the plantation regimes.<br/><br/>

Anansi’s versatile stories and characters were shaped, reimagined, and retold throughout the years by people across the globe. Traditional Anansi tales live on through oral story telling in West Africa and Asansi tales are highlighted to varying degrees in contemporary African literature. Contemporary authors call on Anansi folklore to reemphasize the importance of Anansi tales or to comment on lessons of the past. In <em>Anansi and The Golden Pot</em> by Taiye Selasi, an American Ghanian author, Anansi the boy visits his grandmother back in Ghana. Through his encounters with Anansi the spider, he learns of the relationship between greed and kindness. This modern children’s story beautifully retells and introduces the tradition of Anansi to a new generation.<br/><br/>

Many western authors contribute to the original tales of Anansi. Anansi’s character is represented in many works of art and literature, from graphic art to plays. <em>Anansi Boys</em> by Neil Gaiman was published in 2005 and is currently being produced as a short Amazon Prime video series. This story features the Anansi inspired character Mr. Nancy whose story is revealed through the journey of his two children’s folklore-filled adventures. As Anansi’s character is passed along through oral traditions, literature, and media, a common thread of values and inspiration is preserved in each encounter. Anansi’s spider-like manifestation and essential message of overcoming life with wit, made it easy for people across the world to embrace the Ghanian trickster.",,,,,character image,Anansi (Legendary character)--Legends;Folklore--Ghana; Akan (African People) ,Ghana,5.555,-0.1925,,,,,,,,,StillImage,eng,gyasi_pfp;
apartheid_pfp,apartheid_pfp.jpg,,Apartheid,image/jpg,"The Apartheid refers to the social system enacted by the South African government in 1948. Literally meaning “apartness,” this system seeked to separate the different racial groups in South Africa by drastic institutionalized racism. There was a facade of equality and freedom, but the policies implemented into the law made this impossible. Instead, segregation, classism, and racism became the center of the government. This caste-like system upheld white power while simultaneously pinning people of color at the bottom of the social hierarchy, making social mobility and escaping this system impossible. In 1950, The Population Registration Act was passed, forcing all South Africans to register their race. The Group Areas Act physically separated people based on their race, even going as far as displacing people of color from their homes into neglected areas with other people of color. Black people were forced to rent this property, there were no opportunities to own property. There was an illusion of every thing being separated but equal. However, people of color were far from their culture, workplaces, had little opportunity, and were not allowed to go into areas where white people were, so everything was separate and unequal. Other acts were passed to prevent interracial marriage and any type of sexual relations between races.<br/><br/>

At the center of many of Lebogang Mashile’s works is the apartheid. Her family was exiled during the Apartheid, and when she returned to South Africa after the Apartheid, the effects were still prevalent. Much to her despair, the damage was evident and the people are still rebuilding their lives and relationships with “freedom.” Mashile highlights this feeling in her poem “Insider Outsider.” She describes her home country being a foreign land full of empty promises. The people are left with the scars and no one else seems to understand. Black people are considered outsiders in their own home land because white people wanted to preserve their power at the cost of black people. She describes feeling tired of being different, feeling helpless, and how she will forever carry the scars of the Apartheid. However, she knew she was in control of her destiny. It may be easier to dwell and resent the past injustice, but she chose to take it upon herself to discover her worth and empower other South Africans to do the same. Even if society does not support this, unity and determination will prevail.",,,1948;1990,,cultural concept,Apartheid;South Africa--Race relations;,South Africa,-29.695,24.387,,,,,,,,,StillImage,eng,mashile_pfp;

griot_pfp,griot_pfp.jpg,,griot,image/jpg,"Griots are part of an ancient tradition that still remains today. They often play instruments, such as the kora or balafon, along with their storytelling and involve the audience to guarantee their attention. Griots have been around for centuries and are given their positions hereditarily, the tradition being passed down through family members. Oral storytelling done by griots is the most common way to pass down stories in this region of Africa, with each griot adding different parts based on their personal experiences and performing their unique version of these stories.<br/><br/>

All of these stories are fully memorized by the griots and are rarely written down. One of the most well known tales shared by griots is that of Sunjata, an epic tale about the founder of the Mali Empire. Though the main details of the story stay the same, no griot tells the story the same way, with each adding their own details. In addition to retelling traditional tales and recounting historical events, griots also create their own stories about their communities and current situations. Griots also hold an important position as the genealogists of their families and are tasked with preserving their family traditions. Lastly, griots have historically served as diplomats, advisors, and mediators of conflict, and were highly respected for doing so, though these roles have diminished significantly today and their main focus has become performing. Many modern-day griots travel to share their traditions and storytelling with the world, giving those unfamiliar with western African culture an opportunity to learn about and appreciate their history.",Student B,,,,cultural concept,Griots;Oral tradition; ,"Africa, West ",20.222,-4.384,,,,,,,,,StillImage,eng,

krar_pfp,krar_pfp.jpg,,krar,image/jpg,"The krar is a lyre instrument from Ethiopia and Eritrea, typically with five to six strings tuned to a pentatonic scale. Along with the masenqo and the Washinit, the krar is a key instrument of the Amhara people. Instruments like the krar are played all over East Africa, and the krar continues to be one of the most popular Ethiopian stringed instruments. Now, it can even be amplified, like an electric guitar or bass. The krar was historically used to honor female beauty, as an aphrodisiac and to commend love. It has a very sexual history, and is still used to perform love songs, secular songs and vulgar poetry. The krar is typically associated with sex and femininity, and in Amhara society was viewed as an instrument inspired by the Devil.<br/><br/>

The krar appears multiple times in the Sudanese refugee camp where <em>Silence Is My Mother Tongue</em> takes place. Referred to as “the singer”, the Azmari plays her krar multiple times throughout the novel, but most notably during Saba’s wedding. This would make sense, as the krar is said to inspire and represent sexual, vulgar love and is traditionally played at weddings for those connotations. Here, the Azmari serves as an entertainer, guiding the wedding party through the celebration with songs, prayers, poems, and blessings for the new couple. Now that Saba is married, the krar represents how sex and servitude are expected from her and ultimately, motherhood.<br/><br/>

The krar is often played by the Azmari, poet-musicians from the Ethiopian Highlands that mirror traditions of West African griots. Though a traditional instrument related to masenqo and begena, the krar is associated with outlaws, wanderers, and bandits. In past times, wanderers played the krar to ask for food, and outlaws played it to sing a war song called Fano.

Her poems are most appreciated for their portrayals of feminism, racial equality, spirituality, and post Apartheid social political conditions. She is able to present the complexity and reality of being a black South African woman post Apartheid through powerful and personal rhetoric and tone. One instance of this is her poem Tomorrow’s Daughters, which seeks to inspire young black girls that institutionalized injustice does not define them. They are beautiful, have dignity, and are capable of overcoming racist history by standing up and confronting it.

ribbon_pfp,ribbon_pfp.jpg,,"""Tomorrow's Daughters"" (2005)",image/jpg,"“Tomorrow’s Daughters” (2005) is one of Lebogang Mashile’s most influential poems. It is a message of the power of change, incorporating themes of feminism, empowerment, and race. It urges black women to initiate change and acknowledge their past, but not let it define them, so they can empower the future. The Poem begins by recognising the suppression that Black South African women went through during and after the Apartheid. Mashile states that these women are strong and should not let past history define them. These women redefine gender roles by steadfastly achieving their goals to change the course of history despite society preying on their downfall. They are determined to escape the shackles of patriarchy and racism. Perseverance leads to change, and these women do so with grace. <br/><br/>

The poem then shifts to addressing Emily Dickinson, another poet who challenged society’s notions of women. Dickinson followed her dreams, despite how society viewed her. Mashile urges black women to do the same. She suggests they should express themselves confidently and loudly, with no regard for what other people may think. There is nothing black women can not do. This poem empowered black women all over the world, and paved the way for a career that has led Mashile to become a leading voice in the feminism, and black empowerment movements.
